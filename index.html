<h1>Welcome to my web page</h1>

<p>
    At the moment and for a brief period, I am collaborating as a 
    Research Partner at the 
    <a href="http://www.unglobalpulse.org/kampala">
    UN Global Pulse - Kampla</a>.
    I work with a very interesting group of data scientists, trying 
    to devolop new tools to analyze and visualize infectious 
    diseases data. The idea is to contribute with the Health Service 
    in Uganda, providing them accurate and timely information.
    This is a continuation of my PhD studies in the
    <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/sitran/">ML@SITraN</a> 
    research group, lead by Prof.  
    <a href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/N.Lawrence/">
    Neil Lawrence</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In general, I am interested in applications of probabilistic modelling
    to risk assessment and prevention -like epidemiology or 
    natural disasters-.
