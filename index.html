<h1>Welcome to my web page</h1>

<p>
    I am a researcher at UCSF <a href="http://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/global-health-group">Global Health Group</a>, working on the <a href="http://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/global-health-group/malaria-elimination-initiative">Malaria Elimination Initiative</a>.
I specialize in developing and implementing probabilistic models that aim to
contribute a better understanding of the drivers of infectious diseases as well as health care access of the population.
</p>

<p>
    I am interested in applications of probabilistic modeling to
    risk assessment and prevention, particularly in the topics of health and
    natural disasters.
