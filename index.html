<h1>Welcome to my web page</h1>

<p>
    I am a researcher at UCSF <a href="http://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/global-health-group">Global Health Group</a>, working on the <a href="http://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/global-health-group/malaria-elimination-initiative">Malaria Elimination Initiative</a>.
I speciallize in developing and implementing spatial models that aim to contribute a better understanding of the drivers of malaria infections as well as health care access of the population.

<p>
    In general, I am interested in applications of probabilistic modeling to risk assessment and prevention, in topics like epidemiology or 
    natural disasters.
