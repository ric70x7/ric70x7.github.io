      <p>The last season of Game of Thrones is coming out soon and many of us
      are very happy about it. I thought I would share my excitement posting
      something related to it. So here I will introduce some tools to handle
      geographic data with Python. How is this related with GoT? Well,
      several months ago I bumped into a <i>shapefile</i> of Westeros and Essos in the
      <a href="https://www.cartographersguild.com/content.php">Cartographers
        Guild</a>. This is a forum for cartography enthusiasts. There are many maps of the GoT
      world, but this is the one I found first:
      <a href="http://www.sermountaingoat.co.uk/map/">A Song of Ice and Fire -
        Speculative world map</a>.
      I don't know much about the details of how this shapefile was created, but it
      was made by a fan and it is based on the first book of the series. It contains the
      shapes and names of the continents, islands, rivers, lakes, roads, cities
      and the political borders mentioned in the book.</p>

      <a name="geographic_data"></a>
      <span class="byline">Vector and raster files </span>

      <p>Before starting, if you are wondering what a shapefile is, let me explain.
      A map is usually composed of three elements: points, lines and polygons.
      For example, we can use a point to show the location of a house, we can
      use lines to represent the roads needed to get to that house and we can
      use polygons to represent large objects like parks of lakes along the
      way. How we represent the geographic objects in our map depends on the
      <i>resolution</i> of it. Nothing stops us for representing a house with a
      polygon and add more details about it.  In any case, a shapefile contains
      a description of a geographic space and its features using a vector
      representation with these three elements.</p>

      <p>One important detail about shapefiles that is worth mentioning is that <i>a</i> shapefile
      is not really a single file. It is a set of files with the same name and
      different extensions, the most important being: <i>.shp</i>, <i>.dbf</i> and <i>.shx</i>. The
      first one contains the geometric objects that compose the map, the second
      one contains information regarding the attributes of each object and the
      third one contains a spatial index of such objects. In the case of the
      GoT data, below are some of the files that we will be using.
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ tree
.
├── GoTRelease
│   ├── continents.dbf
│   ├── continents.prj
│   ├── continents.qpj
│   ├── continents.shp
│   ├── continents.shx
│   ├── islands.dbf
│   ├── islands.prj
│   ├── islands.qpj
│   ├── islands.shp
│   ├── islands.shx
│   ├── lakes.dbf
│   ├── lakes.prj
│   ├── lakes.qpj
│   ├── lakes.shp
│   ├── lakes.shx
</code></pre>

      <p>From the files tree displayed above we can see that there is a
      shapefile of the continents, a shapefile of the islands and
      another of the lakes. These are not all the shapefiles
      available and below we will be using others that are not listed here.</p>

      <p>Another way to represent geographic objects is using <i>raster files</i>.
      I will not show how to handle these, but I will just mention them for
      completeness. A raster file can be understood as pixelated image of an
      area. Each pixel represents a rectangular area and the <i>color</i> of
      the pixel represents the average value (of some variable) in such area. For example, if we have a map
      that classifies the land cover (say water, sand, forest, etc.), we can assign
      a color to each category and the raster file will be an image of colored
      pixels according to this classification.</p>

      <a name="maps_with_python"></a>
      <span class="byline">Shapefiles in Python</span>

      <p>In Python, the package GeoPandas allows working with geospatial data in a
      very easy way. By working with spatial data I mean not only being able to
      read it, but also performing operations on geometric objects.
      To load the continents shapefile in the Python environment we just
      need to use the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> import geopandas
>>> got_continents = geopandas.GeoDataFrame.from_file('GoTRelease/continents.shp')
>>> print(got_continents)
   id       name                                           geometry
0   1   Westeros  POLYGON ((16.40672301947538 39.47534753394846,...
1   2      Essos  POLYGON ((66.37511247437433 -11.04801016499505...
2   3  Sothoryos  POLYGON ((53.52211887696054 -41.81379367406902...
</code></pre>

    <p>The variable got_continents is a (GeoPandas) data frame that
    contains the geometry (polygons in this case) of each continent, their name and ID. GeoPandas objects behave very much like Pandas
    objects, but unlike the latter GeoPandas can handle geometries by relying
    on the shapely package.
    </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> type(got_continents.loc[0, 'geometry'])
shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon
</code></pre>
    <p>As we mention above, the geometries in the vector files can be not only
    polygons, but also lines or points. We will load now the shapefile of
    rivers and locations (cities, towns, castles, etc) to show other geometry
    types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> got_rivers = geopandas.GeoDataFrame.from_file('GoTRelease/rivers.shp')
>>> print(got_rivers.head(3))
   id             name  size continent  \
0   1  Blackwater Rush   2.0  Westeros
1   2       Green Fork   NaN  Westeros
2   3       Green Fork   NaN  Westeros

<pre><code class="language-python">>>> got_locations = geopandas.GeoDataFrame.from_file('GoTRelease/locations.shp')
>>> print(got_locations.head(3))
   id            name  size  confirmed    type  \
0   1  King's Landing     5          1    City
1   2  Hayford Castle     3          0  Castle
2   3           Rosby     3          1  Castle

                                      geometry

2  POINT (19.98698396601437 4.621154757349338)
</code></pre>

      <p>In these files rivers are described with lines, whereas the locations of
      different geographic objects are described with points. Note that the
      attributes of the three GeoPandas data frames change. The data frame of
      rivers contains information of the continent in which the river are
      located as well as its size. The data frame of the locations indicate the type
      of object that the geometry represents (city, castle, etc.) and also reports
      some measure of its size.
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> got_locations = geopandas.GeoDataFrame.from_file('GoTRelease/locations.shp')
>>> print(got_locations.head(3))
   id            name  size  confirmed    type  \

2  POINT (19.98698396601437 4.621154757349338)

      <p>Now it's time to make a map. The first thing we will need is to define the
      area that the map will cover. We will define it using the bounding box of
      the map of continents. The bounding box is the <i>square</i> that
      contains the objects described by the shapefile.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> print(got_continents.bounds)
        minx       miny       maxx       maxy
0   0.901100 -11.222474  26.290153  49.102223
1  28.556198 -34.625524  91.918830  16.610754
2  53.516370 -42.002162  91.993586 -31.039566
</code></pre>

      <p>Remember that the continents shapefile contains 3 polygons
      representing three continents. Hence the three bounding boxes displayed
      above. We can get the overall bounding box as follows.
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> import numpy as np
>>> xlims = np.array(got_continents.bounds[['minx', 'maxx']]).min(), np.array(got_continents.bounds[['minx', 'maxx']]).max()
>>> ylims = np.array(got_continents.bounds[['miny', 'maxy']]).min(), np.array(got_continents.bounds[['miny', 'maxy']]).max()
</code></pre>

      <p>We will include the islands in our map, but for the locations, let's
      just display the cities.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">>>> got_islands = geopandas.GeoDataFrame.from_file('GoTRelease/islands.shp')
>>> got_cities = got_locations.loc[got_locations['type']=='City']
</code></pre>

      <p>We will use matplotlib to make the figure, but we will be using the
      packages descartes and shapely to add the different geometries in the
      map. We will iterate along the different data frames and add the
      geometries to the figure one by one.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from descartes import PolygonPatch
from shapely.geometry import LineString, MultiLineString
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize = (8, 8))
for i, gi in enumerate(got_continents.geometry): # Add continents
    ax.add_patch(PolygonPatch(gi, color='burlywood', ec='gray', lw=1))
    ax.text(gi.centroid.xy[0][0], gi.centroid.xy[1][0], s=got_continents.iloc[i]['name'], fontsize=18, color='k')
for gi in got_islands.geometry: # Add islands
    ax.add_patch(PolygonPatch(gi, color='burlywood', ec='k', lw=1))
for gi in got_rivers.geometry: # Add rivers
    if isinstance(gi, LineString): # Some rivers are defined as a single line
        ax.plot(gi.xy[0], gi.xy[1], color='cornflowerblue')
    elif isinstance(gi, MultiLineString):
        for j, lj in enumerate(gi): # Some rivers are defined as multiple lines
            ax.plot(lj.xy[0], lj.xy[1], color='cornflowerblue')
for i, gi in enumerate(got_cities.geometry): # Add cities
    ax.plot(gi.xy[0], gi.xy[1], marker='o', color='maroon')
    ax.text(gi.xy[0][0]+1, gi.xy[1][0]+1, s=got_cities.iloc[i]['name'], color='k')

# Set the x and y limits of the figure
ax.set_xlim(*xlims)
ax.set_ylim(*ylims)

ax.grid(linestyle='--') # add grid

# Remove labels
ax.axes.get_xaxis().set_ticklabels([])
ax.axes.get_yaxis().set_ticklabels([])

    <p>The output of the code above is this map.</p>
