                    <p>
                    This is a project I worked on when I was doing research at
                    The Institute for Global Health Sciences at
                    the University of California San Francisco. The results of
                    this work was published last year in
                    <a
                    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67666-3">Scientific
                    Reports</a>. I won't go through all the details in the
                    paper here, I will simply highlight the main ideas of the
                    methodology.
                    The objective of the
                    project was to <b>Develop a cost-effective sampling scheme to
                    allow for targeted interventions</b>.
                    </p>

										<h2 id="content">Why was this a topic worth researching?</h2>

                    <p>
                    Let's start with some context. At the moment of writing the
                    trends of control and elimination of different Neglected Tropical
                    Diseases (NTD) was very positive. Hence the prevalence had
                    been showing a reduction over the last years.
                    The challenge in this scenario is that a disease
                    transmission declines, the disease 'retreats' to smaller and
                    smaller areas and, it becomes needed to use coarser scales
                    to track it and respond to it. Bear in mind that
                    prevalence is usually measured by using Cross
                    Sectional Surveys, which are representative at
                    administrative units (eg. Counties, Districts,
                    Subdistricts, etc.).
                    </p>

                    <p>The areas that require a response are generally referred
                    to as <b>hotspots</b>. This are locations where the prevalence of
                    the disease of interest is above some specific
                    threshold</p>.

										<h2 id="content">Sampling Scheme Proposed</h2>


                    The sampling scheme proposed consists in the following
                    steps:
                    <ol start=0>
                    <li>We start with some data available. For example from a
                    cross sectional survey.</li>
                    <li>We use this data to estimate the prevalence in an
                    area of interest.</li>
                    <li>Based on the prevalence estimates, we then identify which
                    sites are hotspots.</li>
                    <li>Given the distribution of hotspots we now decide which
                    places should be visited and sampled next.</li>
                    <li>Finally, we collect data from the sites visited and return
                    to Step 1.</li>
                    </ol>

                    alt="Sampling Scheme" width="1400">

										<h3 id="content">Step 1 - Estimate Prevalence</h3>

                    <p>
                    The first step consisted of a Spatial Regression. A
                    quick introduction to the topic is given in
                    <a href="spatial-regression.html" class="link">this
                    post</a>). For the moment it suffices to say that with this
                    type of regression model we are able to characterize how
                    prevalence varies due to factors like elevation,
                    temperature, distance to water bodies, and also due to
                    the distance between sites. I want to make emphasis in the
                    spatial component since it helps the following steps to
                    become more intuitive. As an example say that we have
                    10 different sites as shown in the map below. With this
                    model we learn a covariance matrix (see heatmap) where the
                    covariance is higher the closer the sites, and decreases in
                    the more distant they are.
                    </p>

                    alt="Heatmap" width="1400">

										<h3 id="content">Step 2 - Identify Hotspots</h3>

                    <p>
                    This step consists in identifying which sites are hotspots.
                    Remember that the threshold for determining a hotspot is a
                    value already given. Our spatial model allows not only to
                    estimate the prevalence, but also to estimate the
                    probability of being above or below the threshold. We can
                    use this to predict in which places (even the ones where we
                    have not collected data yet) are hotspots.
                    </p>

                    alt="classification" width="1400">

										<h3 id="content">Step 3 - Decide Where to Survey Next</h3>

                    <p>Now we move to a more interesting step. <B>How to decide which
                    sites to sample next?</b>
                    We want to find hotspots. If our model is certain that a
                    site is a hotspot, then there is no need to include
                    it in the survey since we already found it.
                    If our model is certain that a site is not a hotspot, there
                    is also no need to survey that site, since most likely we
                    won't find a hotspot there.
                    The sites that need to be checked are those where we are
                    most uncertain about.</p>

										<h4 id="content">Shannon's Entropy</h4>

                    <p>Shannon’s Entropy provides us the mathematical framework
                    for understanding uncertainty. It’s bounded between 0 and
                    1. 1 Being most uncertain.  For example, in a Bernoulli
                    variable with p = 0.5 (the most  uncertain case) the
                    entropy is 1.</p>

                    <p>To give some intuition think of the images below. Each
                    image contains pixels that can be either green or yellow.
                    On the image at the left there is no pattern for green or
                    yellow. In contrast the image at the right has a cluster of
                    yellow pixels in the upper left quadrant and a cluster of
                    green pixels in the bottom right quadrant.  Because of this
                    pattern, we know that the probability of a pixel being
                    yellow or green in this quadrants is not completely
                    uncertain. Hence, entropy is lower in the pixels of the
                    image at the right than in the pixels of the image at the
                    left.</p>

                    <img src="images/adaptive-sampling/entropy.png"
                    alt="entropy" width="1400">

                    <p>
                    So we have a model that gives us prevalence estimates and
                    the probability of each site being a hotspot. With this we
                    can compute the uncertainty (entropy) associated to each site of
                    interest. There is still a problem though.
                    A survey design includes more
                    than one site at the same time (otherwise it's not a very
                    efficient mechanism). If we optimize for uncertainty only,
                    we may end up making a bad distribution of resources. For
                    example, say that the image on the left is a map of
                    uncertainty (not prevalence). Then the area we are
                    most unsure about containing hotspots is the orange bubble.
                    For simplicity, now imagine that the sites we can visit are
                    distributed in a regular grid and that we have a budget to
                    visit 10 sites.
                    A strategy could be to pick all the sites in the orange and
                    yellow areas.
                    But this is not a good strategy. We are not taking
                    advantage of the spatial correlation (remember the
                    covariance matrix above).
                    Once we survey a site, we not only get information about
                    it. Our uncertainty about it’s neighbors also
                    decreases.</p>

                    <img src="images/adaptive-sampling/inefficient.png"
                    alt="inefficient" width="1400">

										<h4 id="content">Joint Differential Entropy</h4>

                    <p>To handle the shared information provided by neighboring
                    sites, we can use a concept called Join Differential
                    Entropy. It tells us the average amount of information
                    contained in a batch of sites. Then our selections of sites
                    to include in the survey could be based not only on the
                    amount of uncertainty in each site, but also on the amount of
                    information contained in the batch.</p>

                    <p>Once we define an adequate trade-off between these two
                    components, the selection of sites in our example looks as
                    in the image below.</p>

                    <img src="images/adaptive-sampling/efficient.png"
                    alt="efficient" width="1400">

										<h3 id="content">Step 4 - Collect Data</h3>

                    The last step is to carry on the survey, add the new data
                    collected to the historic database and go back to Step 1.

										<h2 id="content">Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>There are more details in the
                    <a
                    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67666-3">paper</a>,
                    including a set of experimental results. Here I will only
                    mention that our results suggested that with this Adaptive
                    Design the number of sites surveyed can be
                    reduced considerably (more than half) and we still
                    achieve similar results than when using a Random
                    Design.</p>
