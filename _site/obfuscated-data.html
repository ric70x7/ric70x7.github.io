                    <p>
                    Some time ago I worked on a project to estimate population
                    access to electricity in Africa. This was a very
                    interesting project where we used georeferenced data from
                    DHS surveys, World Population Data, Land Use and Land Cover images and Nighttime
                    Light (NTL) satellite images. It took me a while, but it finally got
                    published in 2019 (<a
                    href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214635">
                    link to publication here</a>). And since this was a peer reviewed publication,
                    I had to put a good amount of effort addressing the reviewers comments
                    and questions.
                    One of the reviewers questions in particular forced me
                    to think carefully about the methodology I was using and
                    made me to learn something I found quite interesting.
                    This post is about that question in particular.
                    Just for fun, I'll go through this explanation using the <b>STAR</b>
                    method
                    (<b>S</b>ituation, <b>T</b>ask,
                    <b>A</b>ction, <b>R</b>esult).
                    </p>

										<h2 id="situation">Situation</h2>

                    <p>
                    We were modeling annual Household Electricity Access in Africa
                    between 2000 and 2013. The objective of the research was to
                    produce a raster file per year with the probability of
                    electricity access for the whole continent and Madagascar.
                    One of the challenges for doing this was to handle data with different
                    resolutions. For example, NTL and population data being expressed
                    in pixels of 1 Km x 1 Km
                    and DHS data points associated to GPS coordinates.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/obfuscated-data/africa-data.png"
                    alt="africa-data" width="1400">

                    <p>
                    There was an additional layer of complexity when handling
                    this data. DHS survey data provided information whether or
                    not households had access to electricity. This was the
                    variable we wanted to predict for the whole continent.
                    The complexity arose from the fact that for privacy
                    protection the geolocation of the households are never
                    reveled. First the coordinates are
                    aggregated into clusters. Then the coordinates of
                    cluster centroid are randomly displaced. Rural
                    points are randomly offset up to 5 Km, with 1% moved up to
                    10 Km; and urban points are moved up to 2 Km.
                    This means that our target variable (electricity access)
                    and our input variables (NTL, population, land cover) were
                    not aligned.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    DHS has already established guidelines to minimize the
                    impact of GPS points obfuscation.  It is suggested to
                    not compute covariates using direct cell extraction
                    (pixel value that corresponds to the GPS location), but using an
                    average value across a 5 Km buffer around the GPS location
                    reported. That sounds easy, but was I sure this was
                    adequate for this specific application? How could I measure the
                    impact of obfuscation? To be honest, I was happy to not
                    think much about this and just follow the guidelines, but
                    then one the reviewers brought up the same question: <b>"If
                    points are randomly displaced, how can they be used in the
                    statistical model?"</b>.
                    </p>


										<h2 id="task">Task</h2>

                    <p>
                    I had a Geostatistic model that aimed to describe the
                    relation between binomial realizations \(y\) and a set of
                    covariates \(x\), but I was not sure if the GPS points
                    associated to \(y\) were indeed contained in the squares
                    (pixels) associated to \(x\). Hence I needed to define a
                    strategy that lead to a measurable outcome which could
                    help us understand the impact of using a 5 Km buffer. Only then
                    I would be able to answer if this points could be used in a
                    statistical model.
                    </p>


										<h2 id="action">Action</h2>
                    <p>
                    I performed a simulation analysis to assess the impact
                    of the locations displacement.
                    First I generated a synthetic dataset of 10,000
                    observations representing cluster centroids without
                    displacement. Then I displaced the centroids of this
                    dataset following DHS methodology (see image below).
                    Now that I had two
                    datasets, with and without displacement, I
                    fitted Geostatistic model to both and compared the resutls.
                    The details of the steps for simulating the dataset can be
                    found <a
                    href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214635#sec011">here</a>.

										<h2 id="result">Result</h2>

                    <p>
                    When comparing the estimates of the fixed effects I
                    confirmed that there was consistency in between them when using the
                    exact and displaced locations.

                    <p>
                    I also confirmed that the target variable estimates were
                    aligned. The image below shows the inverse logit of the
                    probability of electricity access with obfuscated data vs
                    non-obfuscated data.

                    <p>
                    Finally, this is the part that I found the most
                    interesting of all this small quest. The Geostatistic model
                    used has a couple of hyperparameters that characterize the spatial
                    variability: nominal variance and nominal range.
                    The nominal variance of the model with obfuscated data
                    turned out to be larger, which means a higher variability of the spatial
                    random field. This was possibly driven by the noise due
                    to the locations displacement. The
                    nominal range of the spatial
                    covariance ended up being smaller when modeling obfuscated data. This
                    means that the radius at which two points presented a
                    correlation above 0.1 was shorter when data had been
                    displaced.
                    </p>

                    alt="africa-data">

                    <p>
                    Initially this last result seemed counter
                    intuitive to me. I would expect that the displacement of
                    locations would result in a larger nominal range. However
                    a reduction in the range prevented correlating
                    points that would be assumed to be correlated if using the range of the
                    non-obfuscated data. In the end I understood it!
                    The model with obfuscated data was relying less on the proximity of
                    observations. This may be more adequate
                    considering that we are not certain about the true
                    location of the data. And at the same time this
                    lack of certainty could be inducing a larger nominal
                    variance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Below is an image that helps explain this.
                    The red points represent the actual locations of
                    three observations. The radius of
                    the blue circle represents a hypothetical large nominal
                    range. All points within the blue
                    circle are correlated with A (\(\rho > 0.1\) to be more precise).
                    That is the case of point C, but not of point B.
                    The magenta dots represent potential
                    displaced locations of points B
                    and C. For the sake of this example we do not displace
                    point A. If we use the large
                    nominal range, point A will be still correlated with most
                    of the displaced locations of C.
                    In addition, A will also be assumed to be correlated with
                    some displaced locations of B (which is wrong).
                    However, if instead we use a short nominal range (radius of
                    the yellow circle), A will be
                    considered to be correlated only to a few displaced
                    locations of C, and it will no longer
                    be correlated with any of the displaced locations in B.
                    I think this change in the hyperparameters posteriors and
                    what they represent is really cool.
