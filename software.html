<h1>Software</h1>

<p>
The code I have produced during my PhD is written in python and incorporated in <a href="https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy">GPy</a>. 
This is a machine learning framework for Gaussian processes and developed by the Machine Learning research group of the University of Sheffield.
</p>

<p>
The modules I am mainly involved with are:<br>
    -- Vector-valued Gaussian processes (aka Coregionalization)<br>
    -- Expectation propagation<br>
    -- Mixed noise models
</p>

<p>
Here are a couple of tutorials I have written for getting started with some of GPy models. <br>
    -- <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/GPy/coregionalized_regression_tutorial.ipynb">Vector-valued regression</a><br>
    -- <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/GPy/heteroscedastic_regression.ipynb">Heteroscedastic regression</a><br>
</p>
