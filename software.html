<h1>Software</h1>

<p>
The code I produced during my PhD was written in Python and 
incorporated in <a href="https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy">GPy</a>. 
This is a machine learning framework for Gaussian processes.
It was initially developed by the Machine Learning research group of 
the University of Sheffield, but now it also has many contributors from
different places.
</p>

<p>
The modules was mainly involved with were:<br>
    -- Vector-valued Gaussian processes (aka Coregionalization)<br>
    -- Expectation propagation<br>
    -- Mixed noise models
</p>

<p>
Here are a couple of tutorials I wrote for getting started with some of GPy models. <br>
    -- <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/GPy/coregionalized_regression_tutorial.ipynb">Vector-valued regression</a><br>
    -- <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/GPy/heteroscedastic_regression.ipynb">Heteroscedastic regression</a><br>
