<h1>Software</h1>

<p>
The code I have produced during my PhD is written in python and incorporated in <a href="https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy">GPy</a>. 
This is a machine learning framework for Gaussian processes and developed by the Machine Learning research group of the University of Sheffield.
</p>

<p>
The modules I am mainly involved with are:<br>
    -- Vector-valued Gaussian processes (aka Coregionalization)<br>
    -- Expectation propagation<br>
    -- Mixed noise models
</p>
