<h1>Research</h1>

<p>
As part of my research, I work closely with <a href="http://air.ug/index.html">Makerere University</a> and the <a href="http://www.unglobalpulse.org/kampala">UN Pulse Lab</a>, in Uganda, to model malaria incidence across the country.
</p>

<p>
The collaborators in this project are:<br>
-- <a href="http://air.ug/~mmubangizi/">Martin Mubangizi</a><br>
-- <a href="http://air.ug/~jquinn/">John Quinn</a><br>
-- <a href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/N.Lawrence/">Neil Lawrence</a>
</p>

<p>
We also organized a <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gprs13/">Gaussian Process Roadshow (2013)</a>, in Kampala, Uganda.

This is a preview of a monitor system we have been working on:

<p>
The upper left quadrant represents an incidence 
below the long term average, but increasing; 
the upper right quadrant represents
an incidence above the long term average and expanding; the
bottom right quadrant represents an incidence above the
average, but decreasing; and the bottom left quadrant represents
an incidence below the average and decreasing.
The gray area means that the signal is too weak in comparison to the noise.
