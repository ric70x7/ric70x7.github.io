<h1>Malaria</h1>
<p>
I work closely with <a href="http://air.ug/index.html">Makerere University</a> and the <a href="http://www.unglobalpulse.org/kampala">UN Pulse Lab</a>, in Uganda, to model malaria incidence across the country.
</p>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p>
Gaussian process models are a natural approach for analyzing functions that represent time series. The use of covariance kernels enable to analyse non-linear patterns by embedding an inference problem into an abstract space with a convenient structure.

By combining different covariance kernels, a Gaussian process is able to describe complex functions. Each of the individual kernels contributes by encoding a specific set of properties or pattern of the resulting function.

<h2>Summer School</h2>
<p>
As part of our research, we organized a <a href="http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gprs13/">Gaussian Process Roadshow (2013)</a>, in Kampala, Uganda.

<h2>Disease Monitor</h2>

<p>
We have been working on a monitoring model, based on signal decompositon, that can be used as an early warning system. The idea is to focus on the short-term changes of the infection time series and identify in which stage (out of four) they are:

</p>

<p>
It works like this with real data:

(the gray area means that the signal is too weak in comparison to the noise)
</p>

<p>
Here it is applied to the whole country:
