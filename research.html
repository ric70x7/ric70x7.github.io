<h1>Households Electrification in Africa</h1>
<a name="electrification"></a> 

<div id="main_cols">
  <div id="left_col">

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) collect information about household
    indicators related to wealth in different countries across time. One such
    indicator is access to electricity. Unfortunately, due to the varying
    periodicity and spatial coverage of these surveys, the information they
    contain is not representative at a regional scale. Fortunately, access
    to electricity can be indirectly measured via remote sensing. 
    </p>

    <h2>What we did</h2>
    <p>
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration stellites have been
    capturing images of nighttime light globally since 1992. While 
    nighttime light images do not immediatly translate into electricity
    access of households, we defined a model to lear the association 
    between both. We used information from 73 DHS surveys, light intensity
    extracted from inter-calibrated nightlight images and population density.
    We followed a Bayesian model based geostatistics approach, and used
    integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to make inference on
    household's electricity access in Africa. The model is used to predict
    the probability of a household having electricity annualy from 2000 to
    2015 across Africa at a 5Km resolution.

<h1>Health Care Access in Zambia</h1>
<a name="catchment_areas"></a> 

<div id="main_cols">
  <div id="left_col">

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    Routine health facility outpatient data are an imperfect measure of
    disease incidence in communities. Two main difficulties arise when
    trying to estimate community level incidence from cases reported at 
    the health facility. First, health records are only representative
    of those individuals who sought treatment. Thus, the number of
    cases captured is likely to be an underestimate of the actual number
    of cases captured. Second, as information on the location of residence
    of cases is often lacking, catchment boundaries and populations are
    often uncertain. 
    </p>

    <h2>What we did</h2>
    <p>
    We defined a probabilistic model that encodes the decision process
    of an individual when seeking for treatment and choosing a health
    facility to attend. Our model factors travel cost (based on distance
    and maximum speed allowed by the terrain) as well as the types of
    health facilities in close proximity. The model allows for overlapping
    weighted catchment areas to be defined for each health facility
    depending on its type, travel cost and location of other facilities.
    </p>

    <h3>Travel cost</h3>
    <p>
    <img src="images/catchment_areas/land_cover.png" alt="land_cover" style="width:200px;"> 
    <img src="images/catchment_areas/roads.png" alt="roads" style="width:200px;"> 
    <img src="images/catchment_areas/rivers.png" alt="rivers" style="width:200px;"> 
    </br>
    The travel costs to a health facility were defined using information
    of land cover, main roads and water bodies.
    </p>

    <h3>Treatment seeking and disease incidence</h3>
    <p>
    <img src="images/catchment_areas/tseeking_movie.gif"
     alt="tseeking_movie" style="width:348px;"> 
    <img src="images/catchment_areas/log_intensity_movie.gif"
     alt="log_intensity_movie" style="width:348px;"> 
    </br>
    The left figure shows the likelihood of seeking treatment when that
    a patient presents symptoms of disease, depending on
    the location of the household in the country. The right figure shows the
    anual estimate of infections (log scale) per 5Km in Zambia.

</a> <h1>PLK Response to Disease Outbreaks</h1>
<a name="plk_response">

<div id="main_cols">
  <div id="left_col">

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    Pulse Lab Kampala and its partners are working on a tool to support
    the response to disease outbreaks. This tool uses
    Big Data Analytics to produce data visualisations
    and incorporate risk factor information.
    Unreported disease cases introduce noise to an outbreak tracking system, 
    as they are prone to cause misleading trends.   
    </p>

    <h2>What we did</h2>
    <p>
    We defined a model for estimating non-reported disease cases.
    Assuming some smoothness across time, missing observations of disease
    case-counts can be estimated through the interpolation of the reported values.
    This approach can be improved if we consider information form nearby health
    facilities. 
    For example, usually, after a wet season in a specific region, an increase
    in the number of Malaria cases or outbreaks for other diseases are expected.
    This effect should be similar in all health facilities within the same region.

<h1>Short Term Variations of Disease Cases</h1>
<a name="ts_variations"></a>

<div id="main_cols">
  <div id="left_col">

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    In Uganda, malaria is among the leading causes of morbidity
    and mortality. Different types of interventions can be carried
    on to prevent and treat malaria. Their success depend on
    how well the disease can be anticipated and how fast the
    population reacts to it.
    </p>

    <h2>What we did</h2>
    <p>
    We developed a method to monitor the progress of the
    number of infections of a particular disease. The method
    is based on Gaussian processes and allows
    to study the effect a time series components individually
    by isolating them and explore the short term variations.
    </p>


    <p>
    With this model, we can clasify the infection phase that the
    districts in Uganda are going through.

    <p>
    In the left panel, the multicolored line represents the number
    of disease cases across time, while the red line represents the
    long term trend. The first section, corresponds to a number of cases
    below the long term average and decreasing. The second section corresponds
    to an increasing number of cases, but still below the trend. The third
    section corresponds to an increasing number of cases above the trend.
    The last section corresponds to a reduction in the number
    of cases, but still above the long term average.
    </p>

    <p>
    The right panel, shows the stage of different districts in Uganda across 
    different weeks. White color means that the short term signal is too
    weak in comparison to the noise.
